### **Activity 1 (Everyone)**

#### Using a template repo to create a git repository Savvy Coders template repo

Setting up and configuring the necessary tooling is a worthwhile exercise in and of itself, but can be a bit tedious. So, for the time being, we are going to reap the benefits of using a [repository template](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) that includes all of the linting and VS Code extensions and settings that we should need to get started. As you gain experience, you may choose to further customize these settings to suit your specific purposes.

In this Activity, we will be creating your Homework Repository. This will be the repository that you will use to submit all homework assignments until we start Section 6.

1. Visit the template repo on GitHub: <https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter>
    - > **NOTE:** You should never clone the Savvy Coders Starter template repo directly, you should always create your own by utilizing the "Use this template" button.
1. Click the green "Use this template" button, name your repo `Homework`, and create it
    - Create repository through "Use this template" button ![Example of "Use This Template"](img/UseThisTemplate.png)
    - Naming your repository `Homework` and creating it ![Creating From Template](img/CreatingFromTemplate.png)
1. After your new repository is created, github will redirect you to that repository. Notice under the repo name it says "generated from [savvy-coders/savvy-starter](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter)"

Our repository is now ready to be cloned down to our local environment! However, there is one thing we need to do first, and that is create a branch protection rule.

#### **Protecting Your Master Branch**

Think of our `master`/`main` branch as our finished product/application that the end-user sees and interacts with. Now lets say that we want add a feature to our finished product such as a navigation bar. Next we write some code to the `master`/`main` branch but we accidentally created several bugs. Now instead of simply implementing a navigation bar as intended we have created several bugs that crashes the entire application in turn leaving the end-users unsatisfied.

To lower the chances of these kinds of situations from happening there are two things we can do:

- _**Never**_ commit code directly to the `master`/`main` branch
- Add branch protection to our `master`/`main` branch

Branch protection allows developers to add a very strict set of rules to a projects branches.

To start adding protection rules to our `master` branch lets start by navigating to the appropriate page:

1. Click on our repository's <strong>Settings</strong> tab.
 ![Protection Settings](img/protectionSettings.png)

1. Once inside your repository's settings click  on  <strong>Branches</strong> located on the far left side of the page
![Protection Branches](img/protectionBranches.png)
1. Click on <strong>Add branch protection rule</strong>
  ![Add Protection](img/protectionAdd.png)

Now we can add our protection rules by following these steps:

 1. type the name of the branch we want to protect. For us it will be `master`
 2. Check the box that says <strong>Require a pull request before merging</strong>
 3. _**Uncheck**_ the box that says <strong>Require approvals</strong>
 4. Check the box that says <strong>Do not allow bypassing the above settings</strong>
 5. Click <strong>Create</strong>
  ![Protection Steps](img/protectionSteps.png)

Once that is done you will have successfully added branch protection rules to you're `master` branch! Now we are ready to Clone our repository to our local environment.

#### Cloning a repository from GitHub

1. Copy a link to the repo by clicking the green "Clone or download" button and then clicking the clipboard

    - > **NOTE**: It will be necessary to use the SSH method to clone, rather than the default HTTP:
  ![SSH Cloning from Github](img/HowToSSHCloneGitHubHomeworkRepo.png)

1. In your terminal, navigate to `SavvyCoders` and _clone_ the repo: `git clone YourGitHubLinkGoesHere`
    - > **NOTE**: When you execute the command, notice that after completion you are still inside your `SavvyCoders` directory, you are NOT inside the directory you just cloned.

1. Change Directory, or `cd` into your `SavvyCoders/Homework` directory, `(master)` should be displayed after the directory name in the terminal
1. Run the command `npm install`
    - > **NOTE**: We will cover this command and npm more in the next section. For future reference, here is a [link to that material](#npm), but for now just continue with the current activity
1. We can launch VSCode form anywhere in the CLI. To open VS Code in the current directory where we are, use this command in the terminal: `code .`
1. When you open VS Code, in the bottom right corner, it should prompt you to install extensions. Click "Install"

Now that we have successfully cloned our repository, let's talk about a bit about development environments and version control.

#### Development Environments with git

In short, we'll be utilizing two "environments" when working in our repositories: a "development"/"test" environment and a "production" environment. Normally you would split development and testing to be their own environment, but for our purposes it will be easier to manage just two environments.

- The development environment is where the developer... develops. Not only is this where client requirements are built out, but this can also be a sandbox of sorts to try and build out requirements in different ways or see if a requirement is even possible to meet, however, anything not directly related to building out a current sprint item will stay in the development environment. End users will never interact with development environment.
- The test environment is where dedicated testers on the team will make sure developed features meet the requirements and that nothing "broke". Once development is completed on a sprint item, it will be moved to the test environment, where testing will commence. After testing is completed on all sprint items, the code will stay in the testing environment until the next "release", where the sprint items in test will be moved to the production environment.

#### Version Control with `git`

The above can be accomplished through a variety of means, but we'll be utilizing `git` for our environments. `git` (the command-line tool) and GitHub (the online repository) are fundamental parts of the web developer's workflow, and you'll be using them, or something similar, _every day_ for the rest of your programming career!

`git` works a bit like a Time Machine, in the sense that you'll be able to revert to any saved state within a directory. So if you mangle your site's directory structure, you can always use `git` to revert back to simpler times.

For a more detail explanation, visit here in the [Addendum Of Resources](/AddendumOfResources/AddendumOfResources.md#git-version-control)

#### **Some Basic `git` Commands**

These commands are executed in the CLI.
We installed `git` into our terminal emulator. That's why each of these commands starts with "git" - we need to let our terminal emulator know that we want to access a specific program (`git`)

- `git status` - Display status of current repo, including files ready to commit, modified files, and untracked files.
- `git add fileName` - Add file to 'staging' area

  - `git add .` - Add all untracked and modified files to 'staging' area

    > **NOTE**: Use the `"git add ."` command carefully. This command could add generated files, backups, and config files with stuff you don't want added.
    > There's nothing wrong with using `"git add ."` if your `.gitignore` file is up to date, and you are sure it won't add anything that you don't intend to track.
    > Always do a `git status` first to check what might get added.
    > In general it's better to use (small) specific wild cards like `"git add *.png"`, or simply add file by file.

- `git commit -m "Your Message Here"` - Save a 'snapshot' of your repo with message describing changes

  > **NOTE**: Commit messages are typically written as a direct command/request, not descriptions of the work done.
  > > **GOOD**: "Add navigation menu", "Fix bug in log-in form"
  > > **BAD** "Added navigation menu", "Fixes bug in log-in form"

- `git push` - Add (push) local repo's committed changes to _GitHub_ repo
- `git pull` - Add (pull) changes from GitHub repo to _local_ repo

#### **Creating a Branch on GitHub**

You should recognize when you have a repository open in your Git Bash terminal. You should be seeing `git: (master)` following the name of your folder name in the command prompt.
This not only tells you that you have an open repository but also that you are working on the master branch.

GitHub is currently working on changing this so you may see `git: (main)`.
Both of these refer to the same branch.

Your master branch can be thought of as your main working area. You can create a branch from this main working area that copies the main branch, allowing you to make changes to the code base without endangering your master branch code.

The changes in your sub-branch are isolated to that branch until they are merged back into the master branch.

Look at the following graphic to help with this topic.

![Branch Graphic](img/BranchGraphic.png)

To create a new branch in your terminal, type the command `git checkout -b <nameOfBranch>`.

Once this new branch is created, you should see the name inside parenthesis.

To take the work you have completed on the branch and merge it into master, first go through the git add, git commit, git push process.

When this is complete go to your GitHub account and select 'pull request' from the tabs across the top.

Create a new pull request then merge the <nameOfBranch> with master.

This process can be found [here](Activities/Week2-Review/CreatePullRequest.md) and we will walk through this process during Review night this week.

### **Activity 2 (Everyone)**

Now we're going to create another repository for our in-class work. This means we are going to repeat all of the steps from [Activty 1](#activity-1-everyone), but instead of calling it `Homework`, this repository will be called `ClassActivities`.

Repeat all steps from Activity 1, which includes:

- Creating a repository on GitHub using the [savvy-starter template repo](https://github.com/savvy-coders/savvy-starter) and naming it `ClassActivities`.
- Implementing Branch Protection
- Cloning the repo to your local environment
- Run `npm install`
- Create Development Branch

<br>

When finished with Activities 1 and 2, you should have two new repositories in your SavvyCoders folder: `Homework` and `ClassActivities`. We'll go through the process of doing our first commit and pushes another time, but for now, let's talk a bit about `npm`.

<br>

---

<br>

### npm

[Node Package Manager (npm)](https://www.npmjs.com/) is our dependency-management system.

Now that we have our newly created `ClassActivities` repos open in VS Code, let's take a closer look.

The Savvy Coders template repo includes a file named `package.json`. JSON stands for **J**ava**S**cript **O**bject **N**otation. A JSON file is not JavaScript, but is _formatted_ into key-value pairs like a JavaScript object.

Inside `package.json` is a key named `devDependencies` which lists all the dependencies/packages necessary for our development environment. When we run `npm install`, it checks our `package.json` file and installs the needed packages from npmjs.com.

Some notes:

- You can install existing dependencies with `npm i` or `npm install`.
- Install new dependencies with `npm install <package-name@>` for the latest version or `npm install <package-name@version-number>` for a specific version.
  - For example, let's pretend there was a package called pizza and we wanted to install version 1.5.0. We would run the command `npm install pizza@1.5.0`.
- Ignore any `npm WARN` warnings
- `npm` will tell you how many packages it added like this:

```terminal
added 788 packages from 593 contributors and audited 6753 packages in 22.262s
```

- You might see a suggestion to run `npm audit fix`. **Do NOT run this command**. Normally this command fixes minor security bugs in the packages, but it also often installs the latest releases of packages that could cause issues for our development environment.

### Keyboards and VS Code

Between the pre-work, orientation and tonight, we've spent hours just getting ourselves ready to code. We'll be spending even more hours on our computers typing on our keyboards and working in VS Code, but luckily, there are ways to make those hours easier on ourselves and even save time with some helpful "tricks".

We have an entire page dedicated to Keyboard Proficiency that contains helpful information about various shortcuts on both Windows and Mac operating systems to make your life easier. That page can be found [here](/AddendumOfResources/KeyboardProficiency.md).

As for VS Code, we will cover the basics and some more advanced features naturally as we progress through the cohort. However, you can visit our [Learning to Use VS Code](/AddendumOfResources/VSCodeBasics.md) section on our VS Code Basics page to find some tips and resources on getting a better feel and understanding of VS Code.
